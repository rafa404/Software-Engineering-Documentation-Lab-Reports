# Software Engineering Documentation — Online Food Ordering & Delivery System (AIUB)

This repository contains **Software Engineering course documentation** for an **Online Food Ordering and Delivery Management System**.  
It includes requirement analysis, proposed system features, process model justification, project planning items, and diagrams.

## Project Overview
**Project Name:** Online Food Ordering and Delivery Management System  
**Goal:** Provide a user-friendly platform for customizable food ordering with **live order tracking**, **nearby store recommendations**, and **secure payments**.

## Key Features (Requirements)
- User registration/login and profile management (favorites, order history, preferences)
- Dynamic menu and product catalog (categories, images, pricing)
- **Custom Pizza Builder** (crust/sauce/toppings/size with real-time pricing & visual feedback)
- Location-based store finder (GPS + manual entry, delivery radius)
- Ordering + multiple payment options (cards, wallets, COD)
- Live order tracking (status stages + map-based delivery tracking)
- Ratings/feedback + issue reporting
- Admin dashboard (orders, inventory alerts, product updates, analytics)

## Non-Functional Requirements (Targets)
- Scalability for peak order volume
- Security (encryption, SSL, secure payment gateway; PCI-style compliance concept)
- Performance: fast interactions for browsing/ordering (e.g., <2s response target)
- Reliability: high uptime goal with backups and recovery

## Proposed Tech Stack (High-Level)
- **Web Frontend:** React.js  
- **Mobile:** React Native (iOS/Android)  
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express  
- **Database:** MongoDB  
- **Cloud:** AWS or Google Cloud  
- **Payments:** Stripe or PayPal  
- **Maps/Location:** Google Maps API  
- **Notifications:** Firebase Cloud Messaging / OneSignal

## Process Model
We selected the **Spiral Model** to support iterative development with **risk analysis** and continuous refinement based on stakeholder feedback.

## How to Use This Repo
